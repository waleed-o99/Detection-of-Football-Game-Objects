# Detection of Football Game Objects Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on detecting key objects in football (soccer) game footage—such as players, ball, goalposts, etc.—using deep learning models. The goal is to build a system capable of identifying and localizing objects of interest to support further analytics or broadcast enhancements.

📂 Project Structure
Detection_of_Football_Game_Objects_Using_Deep_Learning.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training, evaluating, and visualizing object detection on football frames.

README.md - Project overview and instructions.

🧠 Models Used
This project leverages the YOLOv5 deep learning model for object detection, benefiting from its speed and accuracy for real-time detection tasks.

📦 Requirements
Install the required packages using:

bash
نسخ
تحرير
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or manually install the main dependencies:

bash
نسخ
تحرير
pip install torch torchvision
pip install opencv-python matplotlib
pip install seaborn pandas numpy
Ensure you also clone the YOLOv5 repo if not already done:

bash
نسخ
تحرير
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
📁 Dataset
The dataset consists of football match images annotated with bounding boxes for key objects like players, ball, referee, and goalposts.

Annotation format: YOLO .txt files with class ID and bounding box coordinates.

Note: Due to licensing, the dataset is not included. You will need to provide your own annotated dataset in the expected format.

🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook:
Detection_of_Football_Game_Objects_Using_Deep_Learning.ipynb
